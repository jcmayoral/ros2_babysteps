Using the Books examples:

- A Concise Introduction to Robot Programming with ROS2. Francisco Martin Rico
  - It is quite similar because I went throught the book and type all from the scratch to make this tutorial (it is not a cloned repo)
  - If you want the official repository go to : <a href="https://github.com/fmrico/book_ros2/tree/main" target="_blank">Martin Rico repository</a>
  - I highly recommend to buy the book.
